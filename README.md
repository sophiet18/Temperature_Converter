**april 2**

The existence of this repository shows the importance of consistently reviewing notes taken from other lessons 
and most importantly, to not aim too high when you are trying to practice what's being taught. 
The mistake from the last attempt was being too ambitious, way off track 
🤔 though in the long run, creating a time converter with value limits and complex calculations isn't too far-fetched!


**code progress**

Created a new layout xml file, though it will not have as many options as the example did, because there are only so many kinds of temperatures 😅 
my bad!
The process did jog my memory a little after minimal week of coding from returning to the office😢

Today my goal is to be able to make it functional!

A good start is being able to write this from scratch in kotlin playground - proves that at least not everything has escaped my mind 😅
